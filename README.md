The purpose is to identify whether a citation exists for a given pair of papers.</br>

The steps to be taken are: 

* Day 1: Introduction to the problem and a baseline solution.
* Day 2: Text based Features. Enriching the base line with additional text features.
* Day 3: Graph based Features. Further improvement with graph based features.
* Day 4: Advanced features (Topic based features).

Thanks to the winner team of Kaggle, Xinlin and Wanghao, to share us their [code and presentation](https://github.com/iauhs/winter_school_DS_QH2017/tree/master/winner_solution).

If you want to share us your solution or your notes of the winter school please contact me : shuai2wang@gmail.com, or push it directly with github.
